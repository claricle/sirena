= Entity-Relationship Diagram Examples

== Purpose

Entity-Relationship (ER) diagrams model database schemas, showing entities (tables), their attributes, and the relationships between them. Essential for database design and documentation.

== When to Use

* Database schema design and documentation
* Data modeling and normalization
* System architecture planning
* Understanding existing database structures
* Communicating data requirements

== Syntax Overview

[source,mermaid]
----
erDiagram
    CUSTOMER ||--o{ ORDER : places
    ORDER ||--|{ LINE-ITEM : contains
    PRODUCT ||--o{ LINE-ITEM : "ordered in"
----

**Cardinality Notation**:
- `||--||` - Exactly one
- `}o--o{` - Zero or more (many)
- `||--o{` - One to many
- `}o--||` - Many to one

**Relationship Types**:
- Identifying relationships (solid line)
- Non-identifying relationships (dashed line)
