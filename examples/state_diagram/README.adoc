= State Diagram Examples

== Purpose

State diagrams visualize the behavior of a system by showing its states and the transitions between them. They are essential for modeling state machines, workflows, and system lifecycle management.

== When to Use

* System state machines and lifecycle management
* Connection and session state tracking
* User interface state flows
* Protocol state visualization
* Workflow and business process states

== Syntax Overview

**States**: Simple text labels or composite states with nested structure

**Transitions**: Arrows with optional labels showing triggers/conditions

**Special States**:
- `[*]` - Start/end state
- `state Name {...}` - Composite state with sub-states
- `state "Description" as Name` - State with description

**State Features**:
- Entry/exit actions
- Choice nodes
- Fork/join for parallel states

== Examples

=== 01: Simple States

Demonstrates a connection state machine with nested composite states, showing transitions, error handling, and complex state hierarchies.
