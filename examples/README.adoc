= Sirena Examples

This directory contains examples for all 24 supported diagram types in Sirena, a pure Ruby Mermaid diagram renderer.

== Quick Start

[source,bash]
----
# Render an example
bundle exec ruby exe/sirena render examples/flowchart/01-basic-flow.mmd -o output.svg

# Or use the library directly
ruby -r ./lib/sirena -e 'puts Sirena.render(File.read("examples/flowchart/01-basic-flow.mmd"))'
----

== Example File Format

Each example consists of:

* `.mmd` file - Mermaid source code
* `.svg` file - Rendered SVG output (generated)
* `README.adoc` - Documentation (in subdirectory)

== Contributing Examples

To add a new example:

1. Create `.mmd` file in appropriate subdirectory
2. Generate SVG: `bundle exec ruby exe/sirena render FILE.mmd -o FILE.svg`
3. Update subdirectory README.adoc
4. Ensure example follows naming convention: `{number}-{name}.mmd`

== Testing Examples

Run all examples through the renderer:

[source,bash]
----
for dir in examples/*/; do
  for mmd in $dir*.mmd; do
    svg="${mmd%.mmd}.svg"
    bundle exec ruby exe/sirena render "$mmd" -o "$svg" && echo "✓ $mmd" || echo "✗ $mmd"
  done
done
----
