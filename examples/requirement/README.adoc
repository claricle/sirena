= Requirement Diagram Examples

== Purpose

Requirement diagrams model requirements, their relationships, and associated elements like risks and tests, commonly used in systems engineering.

== When to Use

* Requirements engineering
* System specification documentation
* Traceability matrices
* Risk assessment
* Verification planning

== Syntax Overview

    requirement req1 {
        id: 1
        text: Requirement text
        risk: high
        verifymethod: test
    }
    element element1 {
        type: system
    }
    req1 - satisfies -> element1
