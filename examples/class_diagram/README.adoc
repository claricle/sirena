= Class Diagram Examples

== Purpose

Class diagrams visualize the structure of object-oriented systems, showing classes, their attributes, methods, and relationships. They are fundamental for software design, architecture documentation, and understanding system structure.

== When to Use

* Object-oriented design and architecture documentation
* Data model and entity relationship visualization
* Interface and abstract class hierarchies
* Design pattern documentation
* System structure and component relationships

== Syntax Overview

classDiagram
    class Animal {
        +String name
        +int age
        +makeSound() void
    }
    
    class Dog {
        +String breed
        +bark() void
    }

**Class Definition**: Define classes with attributes and methods

**Visibility**:
- `+` - Public
- `-` - Private
- `#` - Protected
- `~` - Package/Internal

**Relationship Types**:
- `<|--` - Inheritance
- `*--` - Composition
- `o--` - Aggregation
- `-->` - Association
- `..>` - Dependency
- `..|>` - Realization

== Examples

=== 01: Basic Classes

Demonstrates a complete class hierarchy with inheritance, showing the Animal base class with Mammal and Bird subclasses, and an Owner class with composition.
