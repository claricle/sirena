= Flowchart Examples

== Purpose

Flowcharts visualize processes, workflows, and decision trees using nodes and directed edges. They are ideal for representing algorithms, business processes, and system logic flows.

== When to Use

* Process documentation and standard operating procedures
* Algorithm visualization and pseudocode representation  
* Decision tree mapping and workflow design
* System flow diagrams and state transitions
* Business process modeling (BPM)

== Syntax Overview

----
graph TD
    A[Rectangle Node]
    B{Decision Node}
    C([Rounded Node])
    
    A --> B
    B -->|Yes| C
    B -->|No| A
----

**Direction**: `TD` (top-down), `LR` (left-right), `BT` (bottom-top), `RL` (right-left)

**Node Shapes**:
- `[text]` - Rectangle
- `(text)` - Rounded rectangle
- `([text])` - Stadium/pill shape
- `[[text]]` - Subroutine
- `[(text)]` - Database/cylinder
- `((text))` - Circle
- `{text}` - Rhombus/decision
- `{{text}}` - Hexagon

**Edge Types**:
- `-->` - Arrow
- `---` - Line
- `-.->` - Dotted arrow
- `-.-` - Dotted line
- `==>` - Thick arrow
- `===` - Thick line
