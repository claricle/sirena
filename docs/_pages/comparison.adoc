=== Migration Paths

==== From Mermaid.js to Sirena

**Syntax Compatibility:** 95%+ compatible

**Migration Steps:**

. Replace `npm install mermaid` with `gem install sirena`
. Change rendering calls from JavaScript to Ruby
. Adapt themes from CSS to YAML
. Remove click event handlers (not supported)
. Test batch rendering performance gains

See our comprehensive link:../guides/migration-from-mermaid/[Migration from Mermaid.js Guide].

==== From PlantUML to Sirena

**Syntax Compatibility:** Not directly compatible (different syntax)

**Migration Strategy:**

. Identify diagram types needed
. Rewrite PlantUML syntax to Mermaid syntax
. Test rendering with Sirena
. Adapt theming and styling
. Update build scripts

**Effort:** Moderate to High (syntax translation required)

==== From Graphviz to Sirena

**Syntax Compatibility:** Not directly compatible

**Migration Strategy:**

. Convert graph structures to Mermaid flowchart syntax
. Manually translate layout hints
. Test and adjust node positioning
. Update documentation and scripts

**Effort:** High (significant syntax differences)
