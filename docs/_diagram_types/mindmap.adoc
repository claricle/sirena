:toclevels: 3

== Overview

Mindmap diagrams in Sirena visualize hierarchical information and ideas in a
radial tree structure. They help organize thoughts, concepts, and relationships
in a visual format that mirrors how we naturally think and make connections.

Mindmaps are useful for:

* Brainstorming and idea generation
* Organizing project requirements
* Creating study guides and learning materials
* Documenting system architectures
* Planning and strategic thinking
* Note-taking and knowledge mapping

== Syntax specification

=== Diagram declaration

Mindmaps are declared using the `mindmap` keyword:

[source,mermaid]
----
mindmap
    <root-node>
        <child-nodes>
----

=== Nodes

==== Root node

The root node is the central concept of the mindmap and must be defined first:

[source,mermaid]
----
mindmap
    Central Idea
----

==== Child nodes

Child nodes are defined through indentation (2 or 4 spaces per level):

[source,mermaid]
----
mindmap
    Root
      Child 1
      Child 2
        Grandchild 2.1
        Grandchild 2.2
      Child 3
----

=== Node shapes

Nodes can have different visual shapes using special markers:

[cols="2,2,3"]
|===
|Shape |Syntax |Description

|Default (Rounded)
|`Node text`
|Plain text creates a rounded rectangle

|Circle
|`((Node text))`
|Double parentheses create a circle

|Cloud
|`)Node text(`
|Parentheses reversed create a cloud shape

|Bang
|`))Node text((`
|Double reversed parentheses create an emphasized cloud

|Hexagon
|`{{Node text}}`
|Double curly braces create a hexagon

|Square
|`[Node text]`
|Square brackets create a rectangle
|===

==== Shape examples

.Using different node shapes
[example]
====
[source,mermaid]
----
mindmap
    root((Central Idea))
      Branch 1
      )Cloud Branch(
      {{Hexagon Branch}}
      [Square Branch]
      ))Important Branch((
----
====

=== Icons and classes

==== Icons

Add icons to nodes using the `::icon()` syntax:

[source,mermaid]
----
mindmap
    root[Project]
    ::icon(fa fa-folder)
      Documentation
        ::icon(fa fa-book)
----

Where:

`::icon(name)`:: Icon identifier placed on the line after the node

==== Classes

Apply CSS classes to nodes using the `:::` syntax:

[source,mermaid]
----
mindmap
    root[Styled Node]
    :::highlight important
----

Where:

`:::class1 class2`:: Space-separated class names placed after the node

==== Combined icons and classes

.Using both icons and classes
[example]
====
[source,mermaid]
----
mindmap
    root[Main Topic]
    :::primary-node
    ::icon(star)
      Subtopic
        :::secondary-node
        ::icon(check)
----
====

== Examples

=== Simple mindmap

.Basic three-level mindmap
[example]
====
[source,mermaid]
----
mindmap
    Central Idea
      Branch 1
        Detail 1.1
        Detail 1.2
      Branch 2
        Detail 2.1
      Branch 3
----

This creates a simple mindmap with:

* One root node (Central Idea)
* Three main branches
* Various details under branches
====

=== Mindmap with shapes

.Using different node shapes for visual hierarchy
[example]
====
[source,mermaid]
----
mindmap
    root((Project Goals))
      Features
        )Must Have(
          Login
          Dashboard
        )Nice to Have(
          Dark Mode
          Notifications
      Timeline
        {{Q1}}
          Planning
          Design
        {{Q2}}
          Development
        {{Q3}}
          Testing
        {{Q4}}
          Launch
      Resources
        [Team]
        [Budget]
        [Tools]
----

This demonstrates:

* Circle root for main concept
* Cloud shapes for priority categories
* Hexagons for time periods
* Squares for resources
* Plain text for details
====

=== Research topics mindmap

.Organizing research with icons
[example]
====

        ::icon(fa fa-book)
        Historical Context
        Current Studies
        Key Authors
      Methodology
        ::icon(fa fa-flask)
        Qualitative Methods

        Observations
      Analysis
        ::icon(fa fa-chart-bar)

== Features

=== Indentation-based hierarchy

Hierarchy is determined by indentation level:

[source,mermaid]
----
mindmap
  root
    level 1
      level 2
        level 3
          level 4
----

Use consistent indentation (2 or 4 spaces per level).

=== Flexible tree depth

Mindmaps support unlimited nesting levels:

[source,mermaid]
----
mindmap
  root
    branch
      sub-branch
        detail
          sub-detail
            deep-detail
----

=== Multiple root branches

The root can have many direct children:

[source,mermaid]
----
mindmap
  root
    branch-1
    branch-2
    branch-3
    branch-4
    branch-5
----

=== Text with special characters

Node text can include various characters:

[source,mermaid]
----
mindmap
  root
    Node with spaces
    Node-with-hyphens
    Node_with_underscores
    Node (with parentheses)
----

Note: Use appropriate shape markers to avoid syntax conflicts.

== Limitations

=== Currently not supported

The following Mermaid mindmap features are not yet supported in Sirena:

* Comments using `%%`
* HTML line breaks `<br/>` in node text
* Markdown formatting in node content
* Custom themes beyond shape-based styling
* Click events and links

=== Known issues

* Very deep hierarchies may require layout adjustment
* Long node text may overlap in dense mindmaps
* Icon rendering depends on icon library availability

== Best practices

=== Keep the root concise

Use a clear, focused root concept:

[source,mermaid]
----
%% Good
mindmap
  root((Product Strategy))

%% Too broad
mindmap
  root((Everything About Our Company And All Its Products))
----

=== Use shapes meaningfully

Apply shapes consistently to indicate node types:

[source,mermaid]
----
mindmap
  root((Main Goal))
    {{Category 1}}  %% Hexagons for categories
      [Action Item]  %% Squares for actions
      [Action Item]
    {{Category 2}}
      [Action Item]
      [Action Item]
----

=== Limit depth

Keep hierarchies manageable (typically 3-4 levels):

[source,mermaid]
----
%% Good - Clear and scannable
mindmap
  root
    branch
      detail
      detail

%% Too deep - Hard to follow
mindmap
  root
    branch
      sub-branch
        detail
          sub-detail
            deep-detail
              very-deep-detail
----

=== Group related concepts

Organize related ideas under common branches:

[source,mermaid]
----
mindmap
  root((Project))
    Technical Requirements
      Performance
      Security
      Scalability
    Business Requirements
      Budget
      Timeline
      ROI
----

=== Use consistent indentation

Choose 2 or 4 spaces and use it throughout:

[source,mermaid]
----
%% Good - Consistent 2-space
mindmap
  root
    level-1
      level-2
        level-3

%% Inconsistent - Avoid
mindmap
  root
    level-1
       level-2
          level-3
----

=== Add visual hierarchy

Use different shapes to create visual levels:

[source,mermaid]
----
mindmap
  root((Theme))
    {{Main Branch}}
      )Important Concept(
        Regular Detail
        Regular Detail
----

=== Keep node text concise

Use brief, descriptive labels:

[source,mermaid]
----
%% Good
mindmap
  root
    Clear Label
    Brief Description
    Concise Point

%% Too verbose
mindmap
  root
    This is a very long description that explains everything in detail
    Another lengthy explanation that should probably be shortened
