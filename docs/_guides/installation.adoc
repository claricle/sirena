== Troubleshooting

=== Command Not Found

If `sirena` command is not found after installation, ensure your gem bin directory is in your PATH:

[source,shell]
----
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.gem/ruby/X.X.0/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
----

Replace `X.X.0` with your Ruby version.

=== Permission Errors

If you encounter permission errors during installation, try:

[source,shell]
----
gem install sirena --user-install
----

Or use a Ruby version manager like `rbenv` or `rvm`.
